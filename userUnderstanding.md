# What is important:

Your idea of minting songs as NFTs on the blockchain and creating a system where listeners "loan" the NFTs while generating returns for both listeners and artists is certainly innovative. It introduces a unique way to financially support artists and engage listeners. The concept of generating a number akin to a stock price for the artist's work adds an intriguing gamified aspect, potentially enhancing engagement and excitement.

However, it's important to consider a few aspects:

User Understanding: While the concept is exciting, ensuring that users, especially those unfamiliar with blockchain and NFTs, can easily understand and participate is crucial. Presenting the idea in a user-friendly and straightforward manner will be key to its adoption.

Sustainability: Ensuring that the returns for both listeners and artists are sustainable and can provide meaningful benefits is important for the long-term success of the platform.

Technical Implementation: The technical implementation of minting NFTs, tracking loans, and managing returns can be complex. Thorough testing and security considerations are paramount.

Legal and Regulatory Considerations: Depending on your jurisdiction, the platform's features and how returns are generated might have legal implications. Consultation with legal experts could help navigate any potential issues.

Artist Involvement: Getting artists on board and explaining how this new model benefits them is crucial. Ensuring that artists see real value in the returns and the exposure gained will be important.

User Experience: The platform's user interface and experience should be intuitive and engaging, making it easy for both artists and listeners to participate.

Overall, your idea aligns well with the evolving landscape of blockchain and music. It's an exciting and forward-thinking concept that could potentially reshape how music is consumed and artists are supported. The key will be in how effectively you communicate and execute this concept to make it accessible and appealing to a wide audience.

# How to help users understand


Absolutely, user understanding is paramount to the success of any new platform or concept. Here are a few strategies to help you communicate the value of your app without overwhelming users with technical details:

Simplified Language: Use plain and simple language in your app's interface, marketing materials, and onboarding process. Avoid technical jargon and complex terms that might confuse or intimidate users.

Visuals and Icons: Visual aids, icons, and graphics can help convey complex concepts in a more approachable way. For example, you could use diagrams or icons to represent the process of loaning NFTs and splitting returns.

Step-by-Step Walkthrough: Provide a step-by-step guide or interactive walkthrough when users first join the platform. This can help them understand how things work in a user-friendly manner.

FAQs and Help Center: Create a comprehensive FAQ section or help center where users can find answers to common questions. Keep the explanations concise and easy to follow.

Short Video Introductions: Consider creating short videos that introduce your platform and its key features. Videos can be more engaging and can help users visualize how things work.

Engaging Stories: Share success stories from artists and listeners who have benefited from your platform. Real-world examples can help users relate to the value your platform provides.

Progressive Disclosure: Instead of overwhelming users with all the details upfront, consider using progressive disclosure. Present basic information first and provide more details as users become more comfortable with the platform.

In-App Education: Use tooltips, pop-ups, or info bubbles strategically within the app to explain features and processes as users encounter them.

Support Channels: Offer clear ways for users to contact support if they have questions or concerns. A responsive support team can help users feel more confident about using your platform.

Beta Testing and Feedback: Consider running a beta testing phase where you gather feedback from early users. This can help you identify areas where users might be confused and make necessary improvements.

Remember, your goal is to make the platform's value proposition clear and inviting. Users should feel excited about participating without feeling overwhelmed by the technical intricacies. By focusing on user experience, clear communication, and gradual education, you can create an inviting environment for users of all backgrounds.
