## Juke Coin Overview

### Definition and purpose of Juke Coins

Juke Coins are digital tokens at the heart of Juke.fyi, designed to facilitate investment in the music industry. These tokens represent a user's stake in an artist's potential growth and success. The purpose of Juke Coins is to provide a medium for fans to financially support and invest in their favorite artists, while also potentially earning returns based on the artists' career advancements. They embody a new, blockchain-based approach to music investment, merging fan engagement with economic participation.

### Total supply

For Juke.fyi, the decision has been made to maintain an uncapped supply of Juke Coins. This approach aligns with the platform's commitment to inclusivity and scalability.
