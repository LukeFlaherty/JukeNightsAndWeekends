### What are we??

- An investment platform for listeners to invest in artists
- An additional revenue stream for artists
- A music player experience for listeners

### Can I listen to music?

- We are doing our best to bring you an in-app premium listening experience for all artists.

### Any music making tools?

- We are doing our best to bring a suite of exculsive tools to producers on our platform

### What if I dont know anything about crypto or web3?

That is fine because we use email wallets and guest wallets that allow you to have a low-knowledge experience and buy shares of your favorite artists with nothing but your credit card. While still seeing your shares in your wallet!

- Dont worry, if you make a wallet in the future, we will transfer your shares free of charge!
