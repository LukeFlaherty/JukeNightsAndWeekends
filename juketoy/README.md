### What are we??

- An investment platform for listeners to invest in artists
- An additional revenue stream for artists
- A music player experience for listeners

### Can I listen to music?

- We are doing our best to bring you an in-app premium listening experience for all artists.

### Any music making tools?

- We are doing our best to bring a suite of exculsive tools to producers on our platform

### What if I dont know anything about crypto or web3?

That is fine because we use email wallets and guest wallets that allow you to have a low-knowledge experience and buy shares of your favorite artists with nothing but your credit card. While still seeing your shares in your wallet!

- Dont worry, if you make a wallet in the future, we will transfer your shares free of charge!

- Need to find out what music labels can do about all this, maybe they cant do anything? idk, im not going to give them anything

- Do we autopopulate the artists? But not add their music?
  I think this is a good idea because then you could put "This artist has not joined Juke, heres a link to their socials to tell them to join!

### Theory?

Our question is how to onboard new users right into web 3

- allow account creation officially or bringing in outside accounts
- abstract accounts for those who dont have ones
- - make sure the info is transferrable in the future to other accounts
- - gasless? where does it fit in?
- - can you prefund these accounts?
- - account info dashboard in profile to show available balance IF you cant get it in Thirdweb icon
- copy for the connect button? only needed to buy and links to what you own

- give money in exchange for artist tokens: What are the tokens representing?
- - shares of the artist?? No, its weird
- - its just share prices in the artist, supply demand
- - only 10,000 coins, you get a certain amount of the coins and their future value as the artist gains popularity

Artist controls how diluted their stuff is like a company does in the market

By creating more shares they could tank their own stuff

- NEW THEORY

force the account creation on the user, but make it as easy as possible
such as automatically when account is created with email
offer ability to transfer to own wallet later

When person creates account, we grab the email and use it to create an email wallet for the user.
We then automatically connect their account to their profile

- autograb email and display in account tab
- autocreate wallet how
  LATER:
  We allow them to switch to a personal account in the account tab
  Deletes the email wallet and transfers the shares to the new wallet

  What am I doing?
  I am going to displat the email of the account in the account tab
  and then autocreate wallets for users on account creation

  - figure out how to modify the account creation page
  - how to generate the wallets on account creation
    -- account abstraction?

  watch the youtube video on account abstraction
  I am going to display the email in the account tab as a non editable option for now
  I am then going to work on permissing accounts to users on account creation and on sign in if they dont have one.

  - That is done by creating a smart wallet for them in thirdweb and displaying the information about that in the account tab. Userdoes not need any other info

# Post first attempt:

So I couldnt get the smart contract to auto create an account to work with the supabase account creation. I think maybe I can get it working but it would need to fully commit to thirdweb, maybe Ill try tomorrow on a branch

But I did get it to sign up and login with normal supabase way and in account I can allow you to create a payment account which is creating a payment wallet with only an email!

This adds a step to the process but it in trade doesnt give EVERY user a wallet, only the ones that are ready to invest. Its already a big hurdle to invest so Im just adding a step to it

However the thout process is this: You join platform to view artists on the platform, you see someone you like, you want to invest, you create payment wallet in account. You then buy juke tokens with fiat, and then you can use those juke tokens to either trade with artist tokens OR you stake them in the artist but its framed as investing in them. So the user has lost fiat, gottem tokens, and invested tokens in artist in exchange for shares.

You give up fiat in exchange for juke tokens
We own the mass supply of juke tokens, maybe a million total
We permiss one juke token for a dollar
You browse artists
artists have stock price
artist stock price is based on how many people have invested in them
by invested in them I mean staked?
you give up your juke tokens to this artists stake? The more people stake the more yours are worth?

Try to get wallets working tomorrow in as fristionless of a way as possible

- branch with only thirdweb sign in and second hand user creation in supabase
- branch with the account wallet creation with custom wallet connect modal

# Accounts and wallets appear to work for now, but next step is allowing users to claim Juke coins with fiat

- I can set up a stripe and connect it to buying something from a thirdweb contract but thats not the problem.
- I need to work out the tokenomics.
- I cant make Juke a stable coin and peg it to the dollar becasue I cant limit use outside the platform I dont think, maybe later with smart wallets but not top priority.
- I need to figure out how I need to start minting Juke tokens. The following are questions I have:

1. Do I mint and initial amount to myself and then users can buy after that?
2. I dont think that people buy the tokens from me I think they buy them from the contract
3. If I just mint them to myself how do create value with them?
4. Should I just start doing shit and figure it out, thats probably the answer

# Pre real token creation

I think Im going to fully test with fake artists and investors so I think im going to try and set up some stuff in my app to help out w that

- I have a place for users to upload music
- should I make a place for users to create music?
- - could just be a place to record lyrics over 3 test instrumentals
- - template online?

# Been a while:

Keeping these notes here:
Pricing Mechanisms

A pricing mechanism is a way to determine the price of a token. Here are two common types:

Bonding Curve: This is a mathematical curve that determines the price of a token based on its supply. As more tokens are bought, the price goes up, and as more tokens are sold, the price goes down. This is often used in automated market makers (AMMs) on DEXs.

Set Price: This means the price of the token is fixed. For example, 1 Juke token might always be exchangeable for 1 dollar. This is simpler but doesn't reflect changes in market demand.

Since you are using the Mumbai testnet, which is a testing environment for the Polygon network, the "listing" of a token doesn't hold the same significance as it would on the mainnet since no real economic value is generally associated with testnet tokens. They are primarily for developers to test their applications. Pricing mechanisms are also typically not in place for testnet tokens unless you are simulating or testing a particular economic model.

# Current Issue:

I have to individually permiss the ability to buy tokens based on wallet address.

Two approaches:

1. Find a fix to this and proceed to implementing fiat checkout
2. Continue individually permissing permissions and implement fiat checkout

Now that im writing out the options it seems obvious what to do becasue both have effort before implementing fiat checkout so it would be better to just continue towards the end goal wit number 1 rather than waste time on number 2 and features that would be phased out when I circled back anyways.

I guess ill do that

havent taken a look but I have a meeting w matt on friday to talk about feasibility and value prop

What to talk about?
What to ask about?
Why did I want to talk to him?
What am I doing well?
What am I doing poorly?

# Meeting with Matt\

went well just build

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
