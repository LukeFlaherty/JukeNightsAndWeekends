### What are we??

- An investment platform for listeners to invest in artists
- An additional revenue stream for artists
- A music player experience for listeners

### Can I listen to music?

- We are doing our best to bring you an in-app premium listening experience for all artists.

### Any music making tools?

- We are doing our best to bring a suite of exculsive tools to producers on our platform

### What if I dont know anything about crypto or web3?

That is fine because we use email wallets and guest wallets that allow you to have a low-knowledge experience and buy shares of your favorite artists with nothing but your credit card. While still seeing your shares in your wallet!

- Dont worry, if you make a wallet in the future, we will transfer your shares free of charge!

- Need to find out what music labels can do about all this, maybe they cant do anything? idk, im not going to give them anything

- Do we autopopulate the artists? But not add their music?
  I think this is a good idea because then you could put "This artist has not joined Juke, heres a link to their socials to tell them to join!

### Theory?

Our question is how to onboard new users right into web 3

- allow account creation officially or bringing in outside accounts
- abstract accounts for those who dont have ones
- - make sure the info is transferrable in the future to other accounts
- - gasless? where does it fit in?
- - can you prefund these accounts?
- - account info dashboard in profile to show available balance IF you cant get it in Thirdweb icon
- copy for the connect button? only needed to buy and links to what you own

- give money in exchange for artist tokens: What are the tokens representing?
- - shares of the artist?? No, its weird
- - its just share prices in the artist, supply demand
- - only 10,000 coins, you get a certain amount of the coins and their future value as the artist gains popularity

Artist controls how diluted their stuff is like a company does in the market

By creating more shares they could tank their own stuff

- NEW THEORY

force the account creation on the user, but make it as easy as possible
such as automatically when account is created with email
offer ability to transfer to own wallet later

I like this one

Dude just fucking write this shit its not even hard

Okay after comp lock in lets go

It is after comp but not tn

Ugh I really want to but im struggling with motivation. I need to get past this hurdle.

Ill I have to say is im struggling to keep up I want to have this done by my birthday but idk at this point

Idk even know what I should be doing rn

I need to implement account abstraction for users to get automatically signed up upon account creation OR do your own account

Automatically give an account to everyone and store that in DB under auto address

allow users to switch accounts? Does it save your holdings?

Will have to pull holdings from account which I think is what happens anyways??

Or just have all accounts be strictly for my app

oops another day

kkiki is on my desk rn lol
