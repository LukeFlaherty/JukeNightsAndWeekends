### What are we??

- An investment platform for listeners to invest in artists
- An additional revenue stream for artists
- A music player experience for listeners

### Can I listen to music?

- We are doing our best to bring you an in-app premium listening experience for all artists.

### Any music making tools?

- We are doing our best to bring a suite of exculsive tools to producers on our platform

### What if I dont know anything about crypto or web3?

That is fine because we use email wallets and guest wallets that allow you to have a low-knowledge experience and buy shares of your favorite artists with nothing but your credit card. While still seeing your shares in your wallet!

- Dont worry, if you make a wallet in the future, we will transfer your shares free of charge!

### Theory?

Our question is how to onboard new users right into web 3

- allow account creation officially or bringing in outside accounts
- abstract accounts for those who dont have ones
- - make sure the info is transferrable in the future to other accounts
- - gasless? where does it fit in?
- - can you prefund these accounts?
- - account info dashboard in profile to show available balance IF you cant get it in Thirdweb icon
- copy for the connect button? only needed to buy and links to what you own

- give money in exchange for artist tokens: What are the tokens representing?
- - shares of the artist?? No, its weird
- - its just share prices in the artist, supply demand
- - only 10,000 coins, you get a certain amount of the coins and their future value as the artist gains popularity

Artist controls how diluted their stuff is like a company does in the market
